### What I learned
What i learned is, you don't have to overthink the styling. Like, i was so confused on how to centralize the content in the box and i tried several things to centralize until i realized i could just use text-align: center;ðŸ˜‚.

### Continued development
I think i have a big problem with positioning things so i really need to work on that :0
